                    <p>The restaurant "ქალაქური" was founded in 1998 by a passionate Georgian chef named Tamara Bagrationi. Inspired by her grandmother's traditional recipes and the rich culinary heritage of Georgia, Tamara decided to open a cozy eatery in the heart of Kutaisi. The restaurant quickly became popular for its authentic dishes, warm atmosphere, and the love for Georgian culture that Tamara infused into every detail. Over the years, "ქალაქური" has grown to be a beloved local spot, celebrating more than two decades of delicious food and cherished memories. </p>
